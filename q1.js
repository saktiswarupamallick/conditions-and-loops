//Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow the execution of different code blocks based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. In most programming languages, the basic syntax for conditional statements includes if, else if (optional), and else (optional) blocks.

if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}

let num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive.");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("The number is negative.");
} else {
    console.log("The number is zero.");
}
